    ok i'm going to talk about psycho brought because i think 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="2" begin="6.30s" end="9.27s">
    his work really was the start of science 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="3" begin="9.47s" end="13.79s">
    people think that science to so started long time ago with the greeks and 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="4" begin="14.10s" end="19.93s">
    maybe with the arabs there but in actual fact science started with this man 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="5" begin="20.25s" end="21.90s">
    and why do i say that 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="6" begin="22.30s" end="26.94s">
    well let's look at the instruments that he used to observe the planets 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="7" begin="27.19s" end="30.76s">
    he was the first person to really plot accurately 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="8" begin="31.02s" end="33.35s">
    how the planets moved in the heavens 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="9" begin="33.63s" end="36.83s">
    and just look the squid it he skill 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="10" begin="37.04s" end="40.60s">
    that the people who made this separated had let's blow it up 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="11" begin="40.84s" end="43.04s">
    this absolutely beautiful engraving 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="12" begin="43.22s" end="49.09s">
    that was required to make these measurements which are very very difficult without telescopes really ok 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="13" begin="49.41s" end="53.44s">
    there you can see that very accurate measurements of angles were made 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="14" begin="53.66s" end="56.00s">
    at that time by tyco brought ok 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="15" begin="56.27s" end="56.99s">
    and here 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="16" begin="57.11s" end="58.92s">
    are some of his nose 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="17" begin="59.14s" end="59.76s">
    now 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="18" begin="59.92s" end="62.32s">
    it turns out that he died 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="19" begin="63.14s" end="65.95s">
    after the name many of these measurements 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="20" begin="66.22s" end="69.81s">
    and his technician nice bose was 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="21" begin="69.98s" end="70.50s">
    kepler 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="22" begin="71.00s" end="74.22s">
    and this is very fortunate because kepler was a brilliant 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="23" begin="74.34s" end="76.00s">
    mathematician as well 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="24" begin="76.30s" end="77.07s">
    and he 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="25" begin="77.29s" end="79.91s">
    took all measurements of tyco brought che 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="26" begin="80.25s" end="81.85s">
    and 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="27" begin="81.99s" end="85.02s">
    he had to calculate very carefully 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="28" begin="85.18s" end="88.84s">
    the orbits of the planets this is extremely difficulty in fact 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="29" begin="89.17s" end="89.89s">
    he 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="30" begin="90.03s" end="95.00s">
    made his own log tables you know computers and calculators 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="31" begin="95.21s" end="100.10s">
    they used a lot tables to do e very complex mathematics particularly 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="32" begin="100.29s" end="102.38s">
    division was extremely difficult 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="33" begin="102.79s" end="107.63s">
    and he these written out in these what are called rudolf find tables 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="34" begin="108.18s" end="109.48s">
    and the key 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="35" begin="109.65s" end="111.67s">
    but i think that he discovers 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="36" begin="111.92s" end="117.35s">
    was extremely important and here we see some of the original ideas 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="37" begin="117.46s" end="122.75s">
    about the motions of the planets and the particular one that was most important was this one 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="38" begin="122.90s" end="124.84s">
    which is the orbit of mars 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="39" begin="125.08s" end="128.26s">
    and we see that the orbits of mars is not a circle 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="40" begin="128.52s" end="131.63s">
    it's actually an ellipse us and the sum 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="41" begin="132.17s" end="133.70s">
    is one focus 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="42" begin="134.07s" end="134.71s">
    this 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="43" begin="134.86s" end="135.76s">
    was the moment 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="44" begin="135.96s" end="137.66s">
    when science started 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="45" begin="138.24s" end="140.00s">
    when people making measurements 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="46" begin="140.13s" end="143.22s">
    and carefully studied what those measurements meant 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="47" begin="143.47s" end="147.03s">
    and as you know in those days before galileo 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="48" begin="147.17s" end="151.36s">
    and copernicus people thought that the sum went round the earth 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="49" begin="151.57s" end="153.82s">
    in fact common sense suggested as 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="50" begin="154.16s" end="155.74s">
    in the morning it over here 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="51" begin="155.85s" end="160.61s">
    in the evening as over their common sense suggests that the sum goes around the earth 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="52" begin="160.88s" end="163.29s">
    but commonsense can be misleading 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="53" begin="164.49s" end="166.42s">
    science's own commonsense 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="54" begin="166.63s" end="174.29s">
    it looks behind the details to look more deeply into walls seems to be happening tries to find some evidence now 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="55" begin="174.69s" end="178.37s">
    the evidence here indicated that it was actually earth 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="56" begin="178.50s" end="180.64s">
    which circling round some 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="57" begin="182.14s" end="186.04s">
    and that was known people like christian hoy guns very 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="58" begin="186.20s" end="187.68s">
    famous 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="59" begin="187.83s" end="191.12s">
    scientists in fact some people would say that he was the first 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="60" begin="191.43s" end="196.06s">
    physical scientists soul and basically theoretical physicist 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="61" begin="196.52s" end="198.48s">
    because he wrote the first equation 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="62" begin="198.89s" end="200.32s">
    and in fact in a in 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="63" begin="200.48s" end="202.13s">
    in holland in the netherlands 
   </p>

    they put toy guns 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="65" begin="204.29s" end="205.08s">
    banknotes 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="66" begin="205.23s" end="209.95s">
    you'll find that in most countries scientists on banknotes in fact 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="67" begin="210.20s" end="211.97s">
    in britain we have faraday 
   </p>

    and we have darwin 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="69" begin="213.70s" end="219.13s">
    and their here in the netherlands we have toy guns and if you go to ross figure austria 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="70" begin="219.35s" end="220.47s">
    you harsher earlier 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="71" begin="220.59s" end="224.68s">
    it's curious that in america they have politicians on banknotes 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="72" begin="224.97s" end="228.31s">
    he suggests something different from the rest of the world 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="73" begin="228.57s" end="229.31s">
    however 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="74" begin="229.49s" end="230.48s">
    hoynes was really 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="75" begin="230.71s" end="235.69s">
    a physicist and here are some of his drawings he was the first person to propose the 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="76" begin="235.71s" end="237.44s">
    wave theory of light 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="77" begin="237.74s" end="243.94s">
    but he also knew a a lot of mathematics and he also understood and differentiation 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="78" begin="244.38s" end="249.83s">
    here are his drawings of the waves of light coming out from a candle and 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="79" begin="249.84s" end="252.57s">
    here are some of the drawings from his books 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="80" begin="252.68s" end="259.62s">
    and he he as i understood it actually he took the first paint on a spring watch 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="81" begin="259.65s" end="261.18s">
    of clockwork watch 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="82" begin="261.39s" end="262.64s">
    so he is really

    the father 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="84" begin="263.77s" end="266.95s">
    of this watch which people pay a lot of money flaw 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="85" begin="267.14s" end="270.60s">
    compared to this fantastic large which which is a 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="86" begin="270.88s" end="276.32s">
    sort of really an amazing e sort of culmination of technology 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="87" begin="276.49s" end="278.70s">
    which is there any 44 anymore 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="88" begin="278.81s" end="281.17s">
    but in fact this one more accurate than this one

   <p xml:id="89" begin="281.61s" end="282.12s">
    now 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="90" begin="282.39s" end="285.94s">
    hoynes knew the centre of pure roll force law 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="91" begin="286.16s" end="292.90s">
    and the also new or something about satins motions and realize that saturn's rings could not be solid 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="92" begin="293.32s" end="298.23s">
    and so he's really one of the first theoretical physicists if not the first 
   </p>
   <p xml:id="93" begin="298.41s" end="299.79s">
    and he actually understood

    what happened then

   <p xml:id="98" begin="306.45s" end="308.16s">
    was that robert hook

    who it was very really a genius but not very good mathematician 
   </p>

   <p xml:id="102" begin="316.08s" end="320.25s">
    in the letter said you do you think that an inverse square law

    now you can

    actually then solve these problems as most of us know
